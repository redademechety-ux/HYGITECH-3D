The previous AI engineer successfully built a full-stack web application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database) for Hygitech-3d, a disinfection, disinsection, and deratization company. The development followed an iterative approach: first a complete frontend with mock data, then backend integration, and finally, a detailed focus on deployment automation. A significant portion of the trajectory involved extensive debugging of the deployment script () to ensure compatibility with modern Ubuntu versions (specifically 24.04 LTS), correct handling of environment variables, proper  behavior, Python virtual environment setup, and PM2 process management, ultimately revolving around critical file permissions and the core issue of the backend failing to start. The AI demonstrated strong problem-solving in a challenging debugging environment, creating multiple corrective scripts and providing detailed diagnostic instructions.

The user, representing Hygitech-3d, requested a modern and dynamic showcase website optimized for Google SEO (keywords: désinfection, désinsectisation, dératisation). The company offers services to businesses, municipalities, and individuals across Île-de-France, including public parks, shops (bakeries, cafes), factories, homes, apartments, and specialized post-construction cleaning. Key functionalities include a contact form (with fields for environment description, pet/vulnerable person presence), a floating WhatsApp contact bubble, and displaying intervention prices (starting from €99 TTC, with specific examples like Rodents from €250 HT, Cockroaches from €180 HT, Ants from €130 TTC, Bed Bugs from €200 HT). The user also specified their main office address (122 Boulevard Gabriel Péri, 92240 MALAKOFF), email (contact@hygitech-3d.com), and phone numbers (06 68 06 29 70, 01 81 89 28 86). A crucial requirement was an automated installation script for server deployment, including multi-site compatibility and specific DNS entries.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture: React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The entire codebase is structured within the  directory.



-   ****: The main React application entry point. It handles routing (, , ) and initially made a simple  call to the backend. It was later modified to incorporate the various sections of the landing page.
-   ** /  / **: These files define the styling and theme of the frontend using Tailwind CSS and custom properties for Shadcn UI components. They were updated to match the modern and dynamic design guidelines, including color palette (green/teal), typography, and animations.
-   ****: Lists all frontend dependencies (React, React Router, Axios, Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS) and scripts for development and build. Updated with Scripts available in hygitech-3d@1.0.0 via `npm run-script`:

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep in the debugging phase of the deployment script (). The user reported a  error when trying to read the  file, which was a critical issue preventing the FastAPI backend from loading environment variables and thus failing to start ().

The AI's last action was to provide and execute a comprehensive shell script () designed to:
1.  **Verify/Create **: Ensure  exists, creating it with the correct content (MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, etc.) using  to bypass permission issues during creation.
2.  **Correct Permissions**: Set appropriate ownership () and permissions (e.g.,  for ,  for directories,  for ) recursively across the entire  project directory. This addressed the  errors.
3.  **Test Backend Manually**: Perform an isolated manual test of the FastAPI backend using  while explicitly loading environment variables, to confirm it can start and respond.
4.  **Configure/Update PM2**: Create or update  (which was previously reported as missing by the user) to correctly configure PM2 for the backend, embedding the environment variables directly within the PM2 config for robustness.
5.  **Restart PM2**: Kill existing PM2 processes and start the  process using the updated .
6.  **Final Verification**: Perform  tests against the backend API and the frontend to confirm full accessibility after all fixes.

The current state is that this  script has just been executed, and the AI is awaiting the user's report on its outcome to confirm if the backend is finally functional and the site accessible.
